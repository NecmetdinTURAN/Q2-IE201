I wanted to take recursive case which every time it took the first string it would create an initial list which later will create additional list with each new index of the string will go to the every possible string position and go back to the original case.
So if it is "abc" then it will have the following:
creates a string the first time then it will create 2 following strings that then the following letter will go to the first second and third positions and every letter at nth position will be able to go to n positions:
for example initial string has 1 possible place to go 2nd one has 2 and so on

--> a
a--> ba,ab
ab--> cab, acb,abc + ba--> cba, bca,bac =6 = 3!
every possible string has to go the number of places that is equal to the index of the string and every possibility will go the number of times before that so it is going to have 
1*2*3*4*5....*n iterations n= length of string
so it has a complexity of O(n!)
